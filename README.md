# Cryptocurrency Key Generation

This project provides a set of JavaScript modules for generating key pairs for various cryptocurrencies. Each module corresponds to a specific cryptocurrency and follows a similar structure for key generation.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

- Algorand
- Avalanche
- Binance
- Bitcoin
- Dogecoin
- Ethereum
- FileCoin
- Litecoin
- Polygon
- Solana
- Stellar
- VeChain
- XRP

## Usage

### Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install

const algorandModule = require("./algorand.js");

const algorandKeys = algorandModule.generateAlgorandKeys();


Certainly! Below is a template for a README file that you can use for your cryptocurrency key generation project. This assumes that each file (algorand.js, avalanche.js, etc.) contains a similar structure to the algorand.js file you provided:

Key Generation
Each cryptocurrency has its own module for key generation. Below is an example of how to use the Algorand module:

javascript
Copy code
const algorandModule = require("./algorand.js");

const algorandKeys = algorandModule.generateAlgorandKeys();
Replace algorand.js with the module corresponding to the cryptocurrency you want to generate keys for.

Output
The generated keys will be logged to the console:

Address: [CRYPTO_ADDRESS]
Private Key: [CRYPTO_PRIVATE_KEY]

License

Make sure to replace `[CRYPTO_ADDRESS]` and `[CRYPTO_PRIVATE_KEY]` with the actual output placeholders used in your key generation modules. Also, ensure that your project structure aligns with this README and includes necessary details about dependencies, installation, and usage.
